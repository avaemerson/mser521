    <h1>
    Bears are cute.
</h1>
    <p>
        Black bear paw print
in mud thick as brownie batter
if I never saw another person
it probably wouldn’t matter

<p>
I used to bring bear spray
but the bears
then stayed away
</p>
<p>
Be wary of
bears
asking for directions
</p>
<p>
Trailhead signs
point us where we need to go
they warn us of bears and coyotes
of water sources they let us know
but they can’t take our pictures
they’re only wood and steel
if they could just capture those
emotions
soon-to-be-hikers can only feel
    </p>
